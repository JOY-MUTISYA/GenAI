# image_tool.jac

A small project containing `image_tool.jac`.

This repository is prepared for publishing to GitHub. It includes a `.gitignore` and an MIT `LICENSE`.

How to publish from Windows PowerShell (summary):

1. Install Git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Open PowerShell and run the commands in the section below to initialize the repo, commit, and push.

If you use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) you can create a remote repository from the command line.

See the "Commands" section for copy/paste commands.

## Commands (PowerShell)

Initialize, commit, and push to a new remote named `origin` (replace `your-repo-url.git`):

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\Joy alexar\GenAi\JOY'
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

Create a GitHub repo with the GitHub CLI and push (if `gh` is installed):

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\Joy alexar\GenAi\JOY'
gh repo create <your-username>/<your-repo> --public --source=. --remote=origin --push
```

## Notes
- Replace `<your-username>` and `<your-repo>` with your GitHub account and repository name.
- If you prefer SSH, use the SSH repo URL instead of HTTPS and ensure your SSH key is configured.

## Next steps I can help with
- Create a GitHub repo for you (requires a GitHub token/authorization).
- Add a PR template, CI workflow, or more docs.
